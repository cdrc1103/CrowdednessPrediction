## Crowdedness prediction in public transport under Covid-19
During Covid-19 pandemic social distancing in public transport is an important matter to prevent spreading the virus. Thus, it would be beneficial to know when and where there are bottlenecks in the public transport network. Our goal is to reduce the capacity problem by predicting the crowdedness for a specified time interval with RNNs. As a data basis, we mainly use check-in/check-out numbers of Rejsekort users. We supplement this information with data from counting sensors that are installed in a small fraction of buses.
